# Solidity Daily â€” CryptoZombies Journey

Learning Solidity via CryptoZombies and rebuilding concepts in my own words, code, and tests.

## Goals
- Write + explain at least one concept daily
- Recreate examples in my own contracts
- Add tests for each day (Foundry)

## Daily Log
| Day | Topic               | Contract                  | Notes                            |
|-----|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 001 | ZombieFactory & DNA | `Day01_ZombieFactory.sol` | [day-001](progress/day-001.md)   |
| 002 | Structs & Arrays    | `Day02_ZombieStorage.sol` | [day-002](progress/day-002.md)   |

## How I practice
- Re-implement lesson code from memory
- Add 1 small twist (extra check, event, or test)
- Write a 60-second explanation

## Tech
- Solidity, Foundry (forge)
- GitHub Actions CI (build & test)
